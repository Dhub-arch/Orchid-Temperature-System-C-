# Orchid-Temperature-System-C-
C++ project dev-cpp

Orchi-flora planters are exporting orchids to European countries. They have established a new orchid farm to accelerate their production due to high demand. To produce beautiful, long-lasting blooms, orchids must produce energy during the day when the temperature is high, and store that energy at night when the temperature drops. This temperature fluctuation is necessary for orchids to bloom. Without a day-night fluctuation of 10-15 degrees Fahrenheit (°F), the plants will grow plenty of healthy foliage (leaves) but may refuse to flower. 
A night temperature of 60-62 °F is ideal for optimum growth, but temperatures as low as 55 °F will not harm the orchid plant. Daytime temperatures should range between 70 - 80 °F. 
Above facts proves the importance of temperature variation for flowering. Therefore Orchi-flora planters need to analyze temperature variation of several months to find out the best duration for optimum growth of Orchids. 
Orchi-flora planters require a temperature analyzing system and you are recruited to develop a C++ application using structured programming techniques to fulfil their requirements.

Concern on following requirements as well,
•	Store both daytime and night time temperatures daily for a month.
•	Calculate daily temperature fluctuation and average temperature fluctuation of the month.
•	Find average day time and night time temperatures of the month.
•	Calculate maximum and minimum day time temperature and night time temperature of the month.
•	Include a temperature converter to convert figures given in centigrade to Fahrenheit. 
•	Analyze the suitability of the temperature variation according to the optimum requirements of orchids given above.
